   :depth: 3



Requirements
============

Mandatory
---------

* `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ (tested with 1.4)


Optional
--------

* `django-tinymce <https://github.com/aljosa/django-tinymce>`_
  (tested with 1.5.1b2) to type the definition in a beautiful GUI
  (see `TERMS_DEFINITION_WIDGET`_)
* `django-ckeditor <https://github.com/shaunsephton/django-ckeditor>`_
  (tested with 3.6.2.1) to type the definition in another beautiful GUI
  (see `TERMS_DEFINITION_WIDGET`_)
* `django-reversion <https://github.com/etianen/django-reversion>`_
  (tested with 1.6.0) to recover changes and deletions
* `django-CMS <https://www.django-cms.org/>`_ (tested with 2.3)
  because django-terms has an apphook, a menu, a plugin processor and
  a plugin
* `django-haystack <http://haystacksearch.org/>`_ (tested with 2.0.0-beta)
  because django-terms has a search index
* `django.contrib.sitemaps
  <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/ref/contrib/sitemaps/>`_
  because django-terms has a sitemap
* `South <http://south.aeracode.org/>`_ (tested with 0.7.6) because
  django-terms has migrations



Installation
============

#. ``[sudo] pip install django-terms``
#. Add ``'terms',`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``
#. ``./manage.py syncdb`` (``./manage.py migrate terms`` if you use `South`_)
#. Add terms to your urls:

   * add ``url(r'^terms/', include('terms.urls')),`` to your `urls.py`
   * or, if you are using django-CMS, add a page and use the apphook and menu



Usage
=====

#. Add some terms in the admin
#. Choose how django-terms should apply to your website:

   * `Middleware`_ (to give django-terms a try or for development)
   * `Template filter`_ (for production)
   * `cms_plugin_processor`_ (if you are using django-CMS)

The added terms should now be automatically linked to their definitions.

For django-CMS users : display all terms and their definitions with the `TermsIndexPlugin`_.


Middleware
----------

A middleware is available to automatically add links on all your website.
It is not recommended to use it in production because it parses and rebuilds
whole pages, which can be an overkill in most cases (even though django-terms
has excellent performances).

It is also perfect for development: it never fails silently, unlike filters
(see `Exceptions`_ for more details).

#. Add ``'terms.middleware.TermsMiddleware',``
   to your ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``
#. If the middleware applies to unwanted Django applications,
   HTML tags, classes, or IDs, set the corresponding `Common settings`_


Template filter
---------------

A template filter is available to add links only on desired parts of
your website.

#. Choose one of your existing templates
#. Add ``{% load terms %}`` to the beginning of the file (just after
   ``{% extends '[file]' %}`` if you have one)
#. Use the filter ``replace_terms`` like every normal filter
#. If the filter applies to unwanted HTML tags, classes, or IDs,
   set the corresponding `Common settings`_

Example:

   Suppose you have such a template:

     ::

        {% extends 'base.html' %}

        {% block article_header %}
          {{ article.header }}
        {% endblock %}

        {% block article_content %}
          {{ article.section1 }}
          {{ article.section2 }}
        {% endblock %}

   Here is how you can modify it:

     ::

        {% extends 'base.html' %}
        {% load terms %}

        {% block article_header %}
          {{ article.header|replace_terms }}
        {% endblock %}

        {% block article_content %}
          {% filter replace_terms %}
            {{ article.section1 }}
            {{ article.section2 }}
          {% endfilter %}
        {% endblock %}

   Now, suppose you have an HTML class ``code-snippet`` in ``article.section2``
   where you do not want to add links on terms.
   Go to `Common settings`_, and you will find the solution:

     Add this line in `settings.py`::

       TERMS_ADDITIONAL_IGNORED_CLASSES = ['code-snippet']


cms_plugin_processor
--------------------

A cms_plugin_processor is available if you are using django-CMS.
It will parse all plugin output.

Add this in `settings.py`::

   CMS_PLUGIN_PROCESSORS = (
      [...]
      'terms.cms_plugin_processors.TermsProcessor',
      [...]
      )

   
TermsIndexPlugin
----------------

If you are using django-CMS, you can display all terms and their definitions with the "Terms Index Plugin".

Troubleshooting
===============

Side effects
------------

Why?
....

When using django-terms, your HTML pages are totally or partially
reconstructed:

* totally reconstructed if you use the middleware (see `Middleware`_)
* partially reconstructed if you use the filter (see `Template filter`_)

The content is parsed with
`HTMLParser <http://docs.python.org/library/htmlparser.html>`_,
then rebuilt.  See ``NeutralHTMLReconstructor`` and ``TermsHTMLReconstructor``
in `tems/html.py` to understand exactly how it is rebuilt.

List of known side effects
..........................

A few side effects are therefore happening during HTML reconstruction:

* Entity names and numbers (e.g. ``&eacute;``, ``&#233;``, …) are unescaped.
  This means they are replaced with their unicode characters
  (e.g. ``&eacute;`` -> ``é``)
* Additional spaces inside HTML tags are stripped:

  * Start tags ``<a  href = "url" >``
    -> ``<a href="url">``
  * End tags ``</ a >``
    -> ``</a>``
  * “Start-end” tags ``<input  style = "text"  />``
    -> ``<input style="text" />``

.. warning::
   This implies one bad side effect: the unescaping breaks the special
   characters rendering in some complex form fields like
   `django-ckeditor`_.  `django.contrib.admin` is already ignored,
   so you should not encounter any problem.  Otherwise, using filters
   instead of the middleware and/or ignore the correct
   apps/tags/classes/ids using `Common settings`_ will ensure a proper
   rendering.


Exceptions
----------

Resolver404
...........

:Raised by: `Middleware`_ only.
:Raised in: `TERMS_DEBUG`_ mode.  Otherwise the page is ignored by django-terms.
:Reason: This happens when django-terms is unable to resolve the current
         ``request.path`` to determine whether the application
         of the current page is in `TERMS_IGNORED_APPS`_.
:Encountered: In django-CMS 2.3, when adding a plugin in frontend editing.


HTMLValidationWarning
.....................

:Raised by: `Middleware`_, `Template filter`_. and `cms_plugin_processor`_
:Raised in: `TERMS_DEBUG`_ mode.  Otherwise we try to make terms replacements
            work anyway.
:Reason: This happens when django-terms finds a problem in the architecture
         of the current HTML page.
:Encountered: If your HTML page is malformed; if you forget a start tag,
              an end tag, or the final ``/`` of a “start-end” tag.
