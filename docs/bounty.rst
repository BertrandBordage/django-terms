Bounty & donations
==================

.. _bounty:

Bounty
------

django-terms was originally developed for a french website,
`Criminocorpus <http://criminocorpus.cnrs.fr>`_.  Now that it is finished,
I don't have credits to continue development on django-terms.

Maybe you want a new feature in django-terms but don't want to code anything.
First, open an issue on github so that we can publicly decide whether it's a
desirable feature.  Then `send me an email <bordage.bertrand@gmail.com>`_ to
privately discuss the cost of such a demand.


No donations…
-------------

I don't accept donations for the time being.

Others would ask for donations in such cases, but in my opinion that would be
quite dishonest because:

* I've been paid to develop something that became django-terms, even though
  I was not supposed to make it open source, nor to make docs and tests.
* I'm not a street mime, I can't develop properly on the basis of a few bucks
  donated from time to time.
* I don't believe in Santa Claus.

If you're still willing to help with money, see the next paragraph.


…but you can still help
-----------------------

The obvious help is to contribute to the code.

If you're really willing to help but you can't code, you can
`send me an email`_ to say that you like
django-terms, that's always heartwarming :)

If you want to help me with money, please donate to `PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`_
(especially `STM/AME <http://pypy.org/tmdonate.html>`_).  I'm not part of it,
but that's an awesome project that probably is the future of Python.  It's
Python, but way faster.  In a few years, maybe PyPy will become the main Python
implementation, as was attempted with
`Unladen Swallow <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3146/>`_.
Then django-terms will probably be much faster.
