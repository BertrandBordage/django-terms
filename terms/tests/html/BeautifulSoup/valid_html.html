   The Lumberjack Song
  </h1>
  <p>
   I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK,
   <br/>
   I sleep all night and I work all day,
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong>
    He's a lumberjack and he's OK,
    <br/>
    He sleeps all night and he works all day,
   </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
   I cut down trees, I eat my lunch,
   <br/>
   I go to the lavatory;
   <br/>
   On Wednesdays I go shopping,
   <br/>
   And have buttered scones for tea!
