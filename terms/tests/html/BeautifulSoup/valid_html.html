    <h1>The Lumberjack Song</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK, <br />
      I sleep all night and I work all day,
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>
        He's a lumberjack and he's OK, <br />
        He sleeps all night and he works all day,
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I cut down trees, I eat my lunch, <br />
      I go to the lavatory; <br />
      On Wednesdays I go shopping, <br />
      And have buttered scones for tea!
